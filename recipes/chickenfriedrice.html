    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the rice according to package directions â€“ after cooking, pour it on a plate and set aside to cool completely. Once the rice has cooled completely, break it up with your hands into individual grains.</li>
        <li>Heat 1-tablespoon oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet (or wok), over high heat, until smoking. Add the rice, cook and stir 3-4 minutes or until the rice just begins to turn a little darker. Transfer the rice to a small bowl and set aside.</li>
        <li>Turn heat to medium, heat 1-tablespoon of oil and place the chicken breast in the skillet. Cook 3 minutes on each side. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board, cut into very thin slices and then cut the slices into thirds.</li>
        <li>Heat 1-tablespoon oil in the skillet and add the diced onion, carrot, scallions and garlic. Cook, stirring continuously, 2-3 minutes or until carrots are just lightly tender and onions are translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the rice and peas and stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked chicken, soy sauce, sesame oil and mirin, stir and cook another 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>eason to taste with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Push the chicken rice mixture to the sides of the skillet and add 1-teaspoon oil to the middle of the skillet.</li>
        <li>Add the lightly beaten eggs and season with salt & pepper. Scramble the eggs and stir to combine with the chicken/rice mixture.</li>
        <li>Cook, stirring continuously, 3-4 minutes, to give time for the flavors to meld.</li>
    </ol>
